GMS_3DEN is a plugin for the Arma 3 3DEN editor.
The plugin allows you to set many settings for missions such as difficulty.
The plugin automatically configures all scripts and variables used by the mission spawner and exports them to the Arma 3 clipboard.

Usage:
1. Adjust Mission Settings 
	- the Configure MIssion menu provides drop down menus to addjust the following parameters:
		- Difficulty: 4 levels of AI difficulty are available and are defined in GMS_configs.sqf 
		- Static vs. Dynamic: 
			- A static mission is spawned and respawned at the location at which it is placed in the editor each time. 
			- A dynamic mission is spawned in a random location that will usually be different every time. 
		- When loot crates spawn 
			- Crates will be spawned either at the time the mission is spawned or when the mission is complete based on this setting. 
		- When Crates are Loaded 
			- Crates will be loaded when spawned or when the mission is complete based on this setting. 
		- How crates spawn 
			- Crates will be spawn on the ground or dropped on a parachute based on this setting. 
		- Criteria for Mission Completion 
			- All Units Killed: The mission complete only when all units are killed, or the percentage of units that must be killed (GMS_config.sqf) is reached. 
			- Player near mission center: any player has come gotten near the mission center 
			- All Units Killed or Player near mission center: if either condition is met, the mission will be completed. 

			Note - using All units killed or Player near center assures missions can be completed if an AI glitches or AI vehicle goes out of the mission area.


2. Lay out your mission. 
	- Mission Markers 
		- The plugin will use the first marker placed as the type/color/shape/size of the marker that will denote the mission. 
		- when you place a marker, assume its location will be the center of the mission. 
		- if no marker is placed in the editor, the mission spawner will create one using default settings. 

	- the road cone (optional)
		- You can use a road cone to denote the precise mission center while you lay things out. 
		- The plugin will use the roadcone as the alternative means of defining the mission center if no marker is found.
		- simply comment out the line defining the spawn location for any roadcones in the .sqf file for the mission if you do not wish it spawned for players.

	- Define the mission center for the most accurate representation of your mission when spawned.
		- The mission center will be placed at the center of the first marker placed in the editor OR at the location of the first road cone of any kind.

	- Plece objects (barracks, bunkers, walls, etc) 
		- simple objects are allowed when the game engine supports them for that item type. 

	- place loot chests (optional)
		- any item of type "Reammobox_F" can be used 
		- these can be place in the open, on top of, under or inside a building 
		- if none are placed, the mission spawner will place one near the center of the mission 

	- Place Vehicles (optional)
		- Place any vehicles you would like to have patrolling the mission 
		- The center of the area patrolled will be the location at which you place the vehicle 
		- If no vehicles are placed, the mission spawner will spawn vehicles according to the settings in GMS_configs.sqf and any mod-specific configs. 

	- Place Turrets (optional)
		- Place turrets of any type you wish to have spawned. 
		- Turrets may be in the open, on top of or inside buildings, or even under objects. 
		- The mission spawner will attempt to place turrects in exactly the same place relative to any buildings or other structures when the turret is inside, above or below an object. 
		- The mission spawner will spawn turrets according to settings in GMS_congig.sqf if none are definee. 
	
	- Place units (optiona)
		- The plugin assumes the location of the unit is the center of a region to be patrolled by a group. 
		- Thus, the mission spawner will spawn a group of units that will patrol the mission area using the location of the unit as the center of its patrol. 
		- The parameters for each group include minimum number of units, maximum number of units and difficulty. 
		- These parameters are included in the output of the plugin and can be edited later if you like. 
		- The type of unit, uniform and weapons are set by the mission spawner based on GMS_config.sqf and mod-specific configs. 
		- Units can be place inside or on top of ojbects in which case only a single unit will be spawned at the location specified in the editor. That unit will stand in that location until killed or deleted by the mission spawner. 
		- The mission spawner will spawn groups throughout the mission area if none are defined in the mission. 

3. Export the mission. 
	- Select Export Mission from the Export menu. 
	- A dialog will appear when the mission script has been generated.
	- Select copy, then paste the copied text into a text editor. 
	- Save the file in a folder within the GMS\Missions folder tree.
	- Make any changes needed, such as adding a start and end message, or changing mission names or marker settings. 
	- Add the name of the file to GMS\Missions\GMS_missionLists.sqf 
	- Start your server and enjoy your new mission! 

	Note:
		- to be sure only the mission you created is spawned for testing purposes, comment other missions listed for this mission difficulty (such as all missions in _missionListBlue)
		- To speed up spawning of missions, in GMS_configs set GMS_debugLevel = 1;
